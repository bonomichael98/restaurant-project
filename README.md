## 03 Functionality

The project we designed was a landing page for a local business called Rhinegeist Brewery. We implemented 3 third part API's.

The first API we implemented was CocktailDB, a free cocktail database. When you load the page the API returns 3 unique drinks with descriptions.

The second API we implemented was Openrouteservice Geocode Search. The API takes in an address and returns the Longitude and Latitude of the location that was input.

The third API we implemented was Openrouteservice Directions. The API takes in the coordinates of the address that was entered in and returns directions from the starting location to Rhinegeist Brewery.

We used Bulma to style the page.

We used JQuery for functionality of the website.
